Matra-Hachette Alice MC-10 for MiSTer FPGA
==========================================

Work in progress...

TODO:

1. ~~Make it start.~~
2. ~~It is unstable, clock may be too low for the PLL.~~
3. ~~VDG register: U4 (1Y2) and CPU r/w lines are used to generate the U8 clock, which allows writing to the VDG register.~~
4. Sound is not implemented.
5. Joystick is not implemented.
6. Fix keyboard mapping.
7. RS-232 interface.
8. Cassette interface.
