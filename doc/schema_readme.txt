- VDG, pin 20 (DAI12) not connected, required for the VDG to address more than 4k of RAM.
- SRAMs: U9 & U10
- ROM: U3, MC-10 is wired for 16K of ROM
- BUS isolation: U5, U6 (address), U7 (data)
- Data latch U2, lower part of address of data bus
- Data latch U8 for sound output
- Clock divider: U18 and U19 (flip-flop)
- Clock inverter U13 so 6847 and 6803 operate on alternate phases
- Address decoding: U4, U13 and U20, SEL line to G2 of expansion port can disable decoding
- U12 inverts signal to make the logic correct.
